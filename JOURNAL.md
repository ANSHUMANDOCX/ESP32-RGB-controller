## 11/7/2025 1 PM - Did research and completed Schematic  

So i had a 5m 5050 led strip lying around i wanted to make use of it so i am making a Web based rgb controller.

The main plan is that since these are a common cathode leds so i will be using mosfets to control the light for it which will be inturn controlled by a web page hosted on the esp32. 

i will be needing atleast 12v 15amps to power the leds at max brightness for which i will be using a computer smps which i have lying around. The esp will be programmed using a extrnal ftdi programmer since i need to keep the from factor as small as possible.

here is the schematic that i made

## 11/7/2025 11 PM - Completed the PCB   

It was a small one didnt take much time completing the PCB 
ive added holes![Screenshot 2025-11-07 233725](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTE5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--21b662b1a8120b6e71a89de3a80c703d26917a67/Screenshot%202025-11-07%20233725.png)
 to mount it on to the 3d case.
there are 2 header one for connecting the RGB and the other for Programming the board

## 11/8/2025 10 AM - Worked on the web interface  

So... completed the web design for the controller (sort of) at at least it includes all the features like the effects preset colors color picker brightness controller i can do with that will add more features to it if needed

spent alot of time figuring out how to emboss the text but finally figured it out that i was using an unsupported font however learned something
