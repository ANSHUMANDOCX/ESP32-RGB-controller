## 11/7/2025 - Did research and completed Schematic  

So i had a 5m 5050 led strip lying around i wanted to make use of it so i am making a Web based rgb controller.

The main plan is that since these are a common cathode leds so i will be using mosfets to control the light for it which will be inturn controlled by a web page hosted on the esp32. 

i will be needing atleast 12v 15amps to power the leds at max brightness for which i will be using a computer smps which i have lying around. The esp will be programmed using a extrnal ftdi programmer since i need to keep the from factor as small as possible.

here is the schematic that i made
