## 11/7/2025 1 PM - Did research and completed Schematic  

So i had a 5m 5050 led strip lying around i wanted to make use of it so i am making a Web based rgb controller.

The main plan is that since these are a common cathode leds so i will be using mosfets to control the light for it which will be inturn controlled by a web page hosted on the esp32. 

i will be needing atleast 12v 15amps to power the leds at max brightness for which i will be using a computer smps which i have lying around. The esp will be programmed using a extrnal ftdi programmer since i need to keep the from factor as small as possible.

here is the schematic that i made

ive added holes![Screenshot 2025-11-07 233725](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTE5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--21b662b1a8120b6e71a89de3a80c703d26917a67/Screenshot%202025-11-07%20233725.png)
 to mount it on to the 3d case.
there are 2 header one for connecting the RGB and the other for Programming the board
